To create a web based application whilst making use of supporting the tools, methodologies and technologies that have been presented as the core learning material during the training. 
Solution
I decided to create a personal movie database application that would allow the user to keep track of the films that they had watched and rate them.

Requirements

The home page should just give a brief description of what the app is and be the default navigation page.

The user should be able to navigate from/to any page in the website.

The web app should have a page to allow users to input/delete/update movie data that they have entered this includes Genre, Director and rating which can be either a number rating system or an A-F grading system.

Project Log:

To keep track of my progress I created a Trello board so I was aware of the functions that I had completed and still had to complete.

Below you can see two screenshots of my Trello board, I wrote the functionality with the user in mind, this was doing in the form of a user story. I scored each functional aspect based on the difficulty level based on my current skill set.

Testing:
As the testing script was omitted due to complexities no automated testing was conducted. Throughout the development of the project and by making use of AGILE, the features were continuously testing manually either by myself or my colleagues.

Strengths:

•	Allows user to enter data to a database.
•	Allows users to delete data from a database.
•	Allows users to Update and view data from database.

Weaknesses:

•	It is pretty basic but at my current skill level it is perfect and it works this does not really qualify as a weakness. But encourages me to continue to improve.
•	Easy to get carried away with as I was extremely passionate about the creation of the app. You will be able to see this from the improvements I have in mind, listed below.

Improvements:
•	Pull Movie Posters 
•	Allow the user to write a little review in a text box.
•	Allow users to include TV Shows/Games and Comics
•	Allow the user to send an aggregated list based on genre and personal rating via email.
•	Allow users to get ratings from online movie databases like IMDB and/or Rotten Tomatoes.
•	More complicated database so for example many genres for one movie as well as thinking of a way to included actor information and more.


Summary:
It was something new and challenging for myself to create a web app via Flask and Python as well as using Linux in this capacity. But to create something basic at first is always going to be the starting point for something greater. I could have and still wish to improve it and challenge myself further.



The Final Product was then deployed to Jenkins and any changes made to my GitHub was automatically carried over to the build on Jenkins:
